# rolodex-calendar

A hack of @jinahadam's fiscal-master tool, which is in operation at
www.dailyfx.com/calendar. The fiscal-master tool only works for one
current week. Through a user-selectable interface, we aim here to make
it display from one to four weeks.

##Todos

- Make it work for multiple weeks, like a calendar would, only that
  calendars display "by month", whereas we shall display by
  multiple-weeks, where the "week" is indexed from 1-52 in a year.

- Spruce it up, so that it looks like www.dailyfx.com/calendar
  Currently it seems to function but it lacks graphics, which are
  undoubtedly pulled from a proprietary dailyfx code.

- Make hyperlinks possible, eg to press releases, newspaper stories
  and government documents.
